# AlgoTrading

Main goal is to create a terminal for crypto algorithmic trading.

## Desired features
- DiveMode or TestMode (mainnet or testnet).
- Choosing the symbol.
- Choosing the desired strategy.
- Ability to customize the strategy.
- Running multiple bots at the same time using different strategies with different or same account.
- Tracking the progress.

### Final step would be dockerizing the project and why not running the thing on the cloud ☁️ 

### Testing The RSI Strategy on the [40 - 60] Range

#### Plot graph
